## pacman

Replicated pacman game using vanilla java script

Below is a screenshot displaying start of the game

Also note that the grid design has been hardcoded

Some points to note :
  * 4 ghosts which can be located in the centre block of below screenshot
  * Pacman is the one with a radial gradient from black to somewhat orange color
  * The green pellets are power pellets and make the ghosts sacared for defined time
  * In that particular time ghosts can be eaten by the pacman 
  * Otherwise the can eat pacman and game will be over
